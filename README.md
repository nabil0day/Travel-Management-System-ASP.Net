# Travel Management System - 3 Tier Architecture with Web API

This project implements a Travel Management System using a 3-tier architecture and Web API. It is developed using C#, ASP.NET, and follows a DB-First approach for database management. The project emphasizes the implementation of SOLID principles for robust and maintainable code.

## Features

- **3-Tier Architecture**: Organized into distinct layers (Presentation/UI, Business Logic, Data Access) for a clear and maintainable structure.

- **Web API**: Utilizes ASP.NET Web API for handling HTTP requests and providing data services (Verify with Postman).

- **SOLID Principles**: Implements SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) for better code maintainability and flexibility.

- **DB-First Approach**: Embraces the Database-First approach to design and manage the database schema.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- ASP.NET
- Entity Framework (assuming from DB-First approach)
